Key Business Insights

### Overall Sales Performance (2015):

Total Revenue: $817.9K
Total Orders: 21K
Total Quantity Sold: 49K pizzas
Average Order Value: $38.31

### Customer Preferences:

Top months: January and July

The Classic Deluxe Pizza led in total orders and quantity sold.

### Top Performers:

Brie Carre Pizza was the lowest-performing pizza across all metrics.

### Business Decisions and Suggestions
* Based on the insights from the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations for the business:

### Inventory Optimization:

Increase stock of Classic Deluxe and Thai Chicken Pizzas to meet high demand.

Reduce inventory of low-performing pizzas like Brie Carre to minimize waste.

### Marketing Strategies:

Promote Large-sized pizzas as they are the most popular and profitable.

Launch targeted promotions for Fridays and Saturdays, especially in the evenings.

Create combo offers or discounts for less popular pizzas to boost sales.

### Seasonal Campaigns:

Focus advertising efforts in peak months like January and July to capitalize on high demand.

Plan special promotions or events during slower months like April and November to drive sales.

### Menu Optimization:

Consider improving or replacing low-performing pizzas to better align with customer preferences.

Introduce variations of the top-selling pizzas to attract more customers.

### Visualizations in Power BI

Category and Size Analysis: Displayed customer preferences in terms of pizza size and category.

Best and Worst Sellers: Highlighted top-performing pizzas and those needing marketing focus.
